# Arch Linux Dotfiles Bootstrap Script

This repository contains a module bootstrap system for setting up a new Arch Linux installation with my preferred configurations and tools. The script architecture is divided into individual components for better maintainability and flexibility.

## ⚠️ Important Security Notice

Before running this or any bootstrap script, you should:

1. **Read and understand the scripts**: Take time to review all scripts in the `scripts/` directory to understand what changes they will make to your system
2. **Verify the source**: Ensure you trust the source of all scripts
3. **Audit the packages**: Review the list of packasges that will be installed in `core_packages.sh` and `aur_setup.sh`
4. **Backup your data**: While these scripts shouldn't affect existing data, it's always good practice to backup before major system changes
